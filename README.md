- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jastill
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in playing around with lots of different technologies but mostly enjoy creating projects using microcontrollers and 3D printers. I currently have a Lulzbot Mini 2 and XTool D1. Most of my projects are ESP32 based, but I am playing around more with PiPico.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Angular and Firebase.
