- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jastill
- ðŸ‘€ I enjoy playing around with lots of different technologies, I currently enjoy creating projects using microcontrollers and 3D printers. My tools of choice are a Lulzbot Mini 2, Kingroon KP6 Resin Printer and XTool D1. Most of my projects are ESP32 based, but I am playing around more with PiPico.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Angular and Firebase.
